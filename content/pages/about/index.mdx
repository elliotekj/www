Hi, I'm Elliot Jackson, a half English half Canadian product designer and iOS
developer based in France. Currently, I freelance under the moniker of [In the
Field](http://inthefield.co), where the bulk of my client work is iOS-centric
these days (be that UI design, UX evaluation, developing the app itself, or
developing the API it'll interact with). Prior to that I worked at Realmac
Software.

Away from the computer, I play in the back row for my local rugby team,
enjoy powerlifting, and spend an inordinate amount of time looking for
tennis balls my Springer Spaniels have lost.

If you like my work, you can [hire me](mailto:elliot@elliotekj.com) for your
next project.
