I primarily take on iOS projects these days, be that as a UI designer,
a developer, or both. In fact, a lot of my work sees me work with a client from
concept and wireframes all the way through to development, beta testing, and
release.

Having experience as both a designer and a developer allows me to see solutions
to problems that someone with only one perspective might not spot, and allows
me to catch issues in the design phase before they can become a problem in the
development phase, helping you keep to your timeline, and your business keep to
its budget.

For more information about myself, and to see samples of my work, please view
[my resume](http://inthefield.co/resume).

Whether you're looking for one person to take your idea from start to finish,
for someone to help you expand an existing product, or for someone to join your
team for a larger project, if you like my work please get in touch; I'd love to
talk about it.
