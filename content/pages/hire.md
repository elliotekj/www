# Hire Me

I've been in the industry for 8 years or so now, and have worked on 10 large (multi-person, multi-month) projects that have been released publicly, as well as several smaller ones. I have experience ranging from taking a project from nothing to v1, to working on a project that has a decade of backwards-compatibility requirements. The software I've worked on has been used by millions of people, and has been recognized by some of the biggest names in the game. The technical writing on this website is referenced by thousands of designers and developers every month.

## iOS

iOS constitutes the bulk of my client work these days. Generally speaking, my clients like the idea of working closely with one person throughout their project and hire me to take on both the design and development phases myself. That being said, I'm also comfortable working as part of a team, be that in a design or a development role.

## Sever-Side

Most of my server-side work happens as part of a larger iOS project that requires a server component. Usually it'll be a from-scratch implementation, but I have also implemented a public API into a pre-existing web app.

## Get in Touch

For more information about myself, and to see samples of my work, please view [my resume](http://inthefield.co/resume).

Whether you're looking for one person to work closely with from start to finish, or for someone to join your team for a larger project, if you like my work, please get in touch. I'd love to talk about it.
