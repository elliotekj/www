Those are, [apparently](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/), the dimensions a PSB file maxes out at. Out of curiosity, I tried creating a new document at those dimensions and despite having 36.91GB of free space I got the following warning:

[@JonJungemann](http://twitter.com/JonJungemann) tried with 900GB of free space and got the same warning.

If anyone out there has more than 900GB worth of scratch disk space available, I’d love to know <sup id="fnref-175-2"><a href="#fn-175-2">1</a></sup> how much is needed to create a file at those dimensions.

Update: [@ckenney108](http://twitter.com/ckenney108) set a Drobo with 16.75TB of free space as a scratch disk and managed to create the file. It takes up 360GB of scratch space and 4.22GB on disk. I’m not sure why 900GB wasn’t sufficient to create it.
