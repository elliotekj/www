There are plenty of different ways to manage dotfiles. This screencast shows you how I sync mine across machines via GitHub.

I like this solution because it doesn’t rely on any tools other than Git which is more or less platform-ubiquitous. There’s no need to install other scripts or software and if you’re not a fan of GitHub then you can just as easily use Bitbucket or any other host.

Hacker News [commenter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797) StreakyCobra is the brains behind this setup and, as I mentioned in the video, it’s a setup that has served me flawlessly so far.
