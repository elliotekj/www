I find the default background used in ZBrush distracting more than anything and much prefer a solid mid-grey one. If you’re planning on doing screen recordings, you’ll definitely want to change the default too to avoid major banding. Here’s how to go about doing so:

1) Start by going to the `Color` menu and changing the main swatch to the colour you want your background to be. In my case, something about rgb(42, 42, 42).

2) Now go to the `Document` menu and click on `Back` to set the colour, then move the `Range` slider all the way down to 0 to remove the gradient.

3) Once you’re happy with your background, click on `Store Config` under the `Config` tab in `Preferences` to make ZBrush remember your changes once you’ve quit the app.

There you have it, happy modelling.
