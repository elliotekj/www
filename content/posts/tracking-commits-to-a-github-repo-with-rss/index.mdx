Watching a repo on GitHub will keep you up to date with itâ€™s issues and pull requests. From time to time there are repos that need a closer eye kept on them though.

I inspected the page of one such repo this afternoon and to my slight surprise found what I was after: an RSS feed. Props to GitHub for going one step further by providing per-branch commit feeds, structured like this:

```
https://github.com/user/repo/commits/branch.atom
```

A working example:

```
