As per usual, a _lot_ of content got published in the hours following this year’s WWDC. Here’s a roundup of what I found particularly interesting:

- Dan Moren’s [bullet point breakdown](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/06/wwdc-2015-keynote-the-fine-print/ "Six Colors: WWDC 2015 keynote: The fine print") of everything new. He’s gone through Apple’s website and press releases and found plenty of things that didn’t even get a mention in the keynote. If you only read one of these, it should probably be this one.
- 

I watched the keynote, read through Moren’s notes, Dieter Bohn’s [post](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8743035/apple-music-hands-on-wwdc-streaming "I just used Apple Music. It's fine, and that should scare Spotify") on The Verge and the Music page on Apple’s site. Despite what Bohn says <sup id="fnref-223-1"><a href="#fn-223-1">1</a></sup>, I’m still not entirely sure what Music wants to be though. This is what I’m most disappointed about, I had such high hopes. Overall then, I wholeheartedly agree with [Dr. Drang’s piece](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/06/facing-the-music/ "Facing the Music"). More specifically, this portion:

> But while the advantages of a multifunction device are obvious, the advantages of a multifunction app aren’t. The App Store’s success is largely based on tightly focused apps, not sprawling suites.

- Federico Viticci’s [complete overview](http://www.macstories.net/roundups/ios-9-our-complete-overview/ "iOS 9: Our Complete Overview and First Impressions") of iOS 9 isn’t required reading if you watched the event, I did really like this remark in it however: \> The iPad was at an inflection point – still failing to convince some tech circles of the benefits of a tablet – and the changes coming with iOS 9 are a reassuring sign of Apple’s commitment to the uniqueness of the device.

- From Apple’s pre-release Mac Developer Library, [_Responding to Force Touch Events from JavaScript_](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Articles/RespondingtoForceTouchEventsfromJavaScript.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016162 "Responding to Force Touch Events from JavaScript"). This’ll be available for Safari, Dashboard, and WebKit-based applications.

- Also from the pre-release Mac Developer Library, a [redesigned web inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_9.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014305-CH9-SW25) is coming to Safari 9. I’m waiting to be convinced on this — that looks like an awful lot of chrome at the top of the window.

- Last but not least, screenshots! Credit for the [El Cap screenshots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scbtond79crgnru/AAA1Cm6QRO7JkOrU-Uy68esDa?dl=0 "El Cap screenshot on Dropbox") goes to [Jonatan Castro](https://twitter.com/jonatan/status/608195646680662016 "Jonatan Castro’s tweet"). The [iOS 9 ones](http://imgur.com/a/pUbpJ "iOS 9 screenshots on Imgur") come from [/u/roonieone](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3938a2/all_of_the_new_little_details_in_ios_9/ "All of the new little details in iOS 9").
