As of Photoshop CC 2015, Save for Web is deemed a legacy feature. It’s held up pretty well over the years I think, considering it was built on top of ImageReady which was first released in 1998 (again, nice to see the Photoshop team pushing things forward).

If, like me, your workflow relies heavily on Save for Web, then no need to worry just yet. No features have been removed from it and whilst it may be removed in the future, it won’t be going anywhere for time time being. Nor will this update have any affect on your actions and scripts.

From Jeff Tranberry’s [blog](http://blogs.adobe.com/crawlspace/2015/06/save-for-web-in-photoshop-cc-2015.html "Save for Web in Photoshop CC 2015"):

> The new Export As workflows are a complete redesign of how you export assets out of Photoshop. Export As has new capabilities like adding padding to an image and exporting shapes and paths to SVG. We also introduced the Quick Export option, which allows you to export an entire document or selected layers very quickly with no dialog.

I’ve already [written](http://casualnotebook.com/posts/quick-export-in-photoshop-cc-2015 "http://casualnotebook.com/posts/quick-export-in-photoshop-cc-2015") about some of the new Quick Export options, but the “adding padding” part is particularly interesting to me here. It’s absence in previous releases is one of the reasons I have never used Generator for day-to-day work.

From Photoshop’s [documentation][3]:

> If your asset needs to occupy a certain width and height, specify those values as the Canvas Size. The Export As… dialog updates the preview to center the image within those bounds.
