Running any of the scale actions in [Marc Edwards](https://twitter.com/marcedwards)‘ wonderful [Bjango Actions](https://github.com/bjango/Bjango-Actions) leaves all of the folders and layer style summaries open in the layers panel. Instead of always collapsing them manually, I just made a short addition to the end of each of the scale actions. They now collapse everything but the group layer style summaries <sup id="fnref-235-1"><a href="#fn-235-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> for themselves once everything has finished scaling. You can then quickly collapse the layer style summaries for all groups by atl-clicking on one of the toggle arrows (unactionable). You’ll have to be running Photoshop CC for [this update](https://github.com/ElliotEKJ/Bjango-Actions) to work.

- Unfortunately the “Collapse All Groups” command doesn’t currently collapse them. Feedback submitted [here](http://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/photoshop-collapse-all-groups-should-collapse-group-layer-styles-too).&nbsp;↩
