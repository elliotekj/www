This config is very much a labour of love. I’ve spent far more hours tweaking and tailoring it than any normal human being would consider reasonable and as such, I take some amount of pride in it.

I owe large parts of it to the ever active and ever open Vim community, so thank you to everyone who’s configs I’ve raided and blog posts I’ve read in the past.

On a different note, I was slightly more confident in this one. Listening back to it, I could hear the difference in my voice as the recording went on. I need to work on my pauses though.
