In part 1: ["Getting started with
GRDB"](/2019/12/11/sqlite-ios-getting-started-with-grdb), we covered how to
setup a local SQLite database for your iOS app, how to write migrations, how to
adopt GRDB's protocols within a struct that can then be saved to the database,
and lastly we went over some basic querying.

In part 2, we'll have a look at how to observe and react to changes in the
database, how to define relationships between tables, and how to save a custom
types.

---

### Defining associations

To show you how associations work in GRDB, we'll create a tasks table and setup
a "has many" relationship between the project and task tables. Tasks, in turn,
will have a "belongs to" relationship with projects.

```swift:title=DatabaseManager.swift {21}
class DatabaseManager {

    static var migrator: DatabaseMigrator {
        var migrator = DatabaseMigrator()

        migrator.eraseDatabaseOnSchemaChange = true

        migrator.registerMigration("createProject") { db in
            try db.create(table: "project") { t in
                t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey("id")
                t.column("name", .text).notNull()
                t.column("description", .text)
                t.column("due", .date)
                t.column("isDraft", .boolean).notNull().defaults(to: true)
            }
        }

        migrator.registerMigration("createTask") { db in
            try db.create(table: "task") { t in
                t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey("id")
                t.column("projectId", .integer).notNull().indexed().references("project", onDelete: .cascade)
                t.column("name", .text).notNull()
                t.column("isDone", .boolean).notNull().defaults(to: false)
            }
        }

        return migrator
    }

}
```

We went through what most of the above does in part 1; the interesting bit is
line 21, where we create a column named `projectId`. The column is defined as
an integer (because the primary key of the project table is an integer), then
constrained to be `notNull` because we want SQLite to guarantee that all tasks
have a project. `indexed` tells SQLite that we want the column to be indexed,
which'll increase performance once we start querying for tasks that belong to a
project (and thus matching against the value of this column). Lastly,
`references` creates a foreign key constraint which tells SQLite that for each
row in the tasks table, there exists a project it belongs to. `onDelete:
.cascade` upholds that constraint by automatically deleting all tasks that
belong a project when that project is deleted from the database.

Now that the required migrations have been done, create a `Task` struct for the
newly created table (go back and reference part 1 if you're unsure how to do
so). Once you've done that, we can move on to updating our `Project` struct.

```swift:title=Models/Project.swift {1,3,13-15}
extension Project: TableRecord, EncodableRecord {

    static let tasks = hasMany(Task.self)

    private enum Columns {
        static let id = Column(CodingKeys.id)
        static let name = Column(CodingKeys.name)
        static let description = Column(CodingKeys.description)
        static let due = Column(CodingKeys.due)
        static let isDraft = Column(CodingKeys.isDraft)
    }

    var tasks: QueryInterfaceRequest<Task> {
        return request(for: Project.tasks)
    }


    static func drafts() -> QueryInterfaceRequest<Project> {
        return Project.filter(Columns.isDraft == true)
    }

}
```

In the above snippet, the `extension` that housed our queries in part 1 has
been updated. First, on line 1, `TableRecord` and `EncodableRecord` have been
adopted, which gives us access to GRDB's `belongsTo` function. On line 3, that
function is then used to tell GRDB of the foreign key.

Lines 13 through 15 provide us with a nice way to query all the tasks that
belong to a project simply by doing:

```swift
let tasks = try project.tasks.fetchAll(db)
```

Similarly, we can update the `Task` struct to provide us with a way to fetch
the project it belongs to:

```swift:title=Models/Project.swift
extension Task: TableRecord, EncodableRecord {

    static let project = belongsTo(Project.self)

    var project: QueryInterfaceRequest<Project> {
        return request(for: Task.project)
    }

}
```

To then fetch the parent project, all that's needed is:

```swift
let project = try task.project.fetchOne(db)
```

Note that filters can still be applied when querying a `hasMany` relationship.
The following, for example, is valid:

```swift
let doneTasks = try project
    .tasks
    .filter(Column("isDone") == true)
    .fetchAll(db)
```

---

### Observing and reacting to changes

GRDB leverages SQLite's data change notifications to provide us with an
efficient `ValueObservation` tool that will, in turn, call either the
`onChange` or `onError` callback it is passed.

For this example, we'll implement an observer into a simple
`TaskListViewController` whose view we want to update as and when the tasks
that belong to a certain project update.

To start, `import GRDB` and define an optional `TransactionObserver` property
in your controller; this is where our observer will be kept in memory.
`TransactionObserver` is the type returned when `start` is called on a
`ValueObservation`.

```swift:title=TaskListViewController.swift
class TaskListViewController: UIViewController {

    private var tasksObserver: TransactionObserver?

}
```

`tasksObserver` now needs a value. We'll break its configuration out into its
own function; remember to call `configureTasksObserver` in `viewDidLoad`, or
wherever you're handling view setup.

```swift:title=TaskListViewController.swift {12-13}
class TaskListViewController: UIViewController {

    private func configureTasksObserver() {
        let project: Project = ...

        let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db in
            try project.tasks.fetchAll(db)
        }

        tasksObserver = observation.start(
            in: dbQueue,
            onError: onTasksObserverError(_:),
            onChange: onTasksObserverChange(_:)
        )
    }

}
```

When `start` is first called on a `ValueObservation` type, the query in its
definition will run once before any changes are made. This is nice because it
means we don't have to duplicate the query elsewhere in our setup code to fetch
the data required for the first initialization of the controller.

You can see that 2 callbacks are passed into `start` on lines 12 and 13. We
still need to define those:

```swift:title=TaskListViewController.swift
class TaskListViewController: UIViewController {

    private func onTasksObserverChange(_ tasks: [Task]) {
        // Update your UI, etc...
    }

    private func onTasksObserverError(_ error: Error) {
        // Update your UI, etc...
    }

}
```

The only thing left to do is clean-up when the controller closes:

```swift:title=TaskListViewController.swift
class TaskListViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
        tasksObserver = nil
    }

}
```
That's all there is to it; GRDB does a great job of making observation
straightforward.

Tip: A frequest use case for database observation is keeping the data in a
UICollectionView up to date. The
[DeepDiff](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff) package makes a great
accompaniment to what we've just covered if that's what you're implementing.

### Reading and writing custom data types

GRDB supports strings, integers, dates, booleans, and enums (that adopt
`DatabaseValueConvertible`) out of the box. For this example, we'll contrive a
requirement that projects can have a user-defined accent colour and banner
image that must be modelled into a `ProjectBrand` struct.

```swift:title=DatabaseManager.swift {15-16}
class DatabaseManager {

    static var migrator: DatabaseMigrator {
        var migrator = DatabaseMigrator()

        migrator.eraseDatabaseOnSchemaChange = true

        migrator.registerMigration("createProject") { db in
            try db.create(table: "project") { t in
                t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey("id")
                t.column("name", .text).notNull()
                t.column("description", .text)
                t.column("due", .date)
                t.column("isDraft", .boolean).notNull().defaults(to: true)
                t.column("accentColor", .text)
                t.column("bannerImage", .text)
            }
        }

        return migrator
    }

}
```

You can see on lines 15 and 16 that the two new fields still have to adhere to
the basic types when they're in the database, and that they are stored in their
own columns.

GRDB will come into play post-read, transforming the two fields into one
`ProjectBrand`, and pre-write, splitting the `ProjectBrand` back down to two
fields in preparation for SQLite. Let's implement that.

```swift:title=Models/Project.swift
struct Project {
    var id: Int64?
    var name: String
    var description: String?
    var due: Date?
    var isDraft: Bool
    var brand: ProjectBrand
}

struct ProjectBrand {
    var accentColor: String?
    var bannerImage: String?
}

extension Project: TableRecord, FetchableRecord, MutablePersistableRecord {

    enum Columns: String, ColumnExpression {
        case id, name, description, due, isDraft, accentColor, bannerImage
    }

    init(row: Row) {
        id = row[Columns.id]
        name = row[Columns.name]
        description = row[Columns.description]
        due = row[Columns.due]
        isDraft = row[Columns.isDraft]
        brand = ProjectBrand(
            accentColor: row[Columns.accentColor],
            bannerImage: row[Columns.bannerImage]
        )

        super.init(row: row)
    }

    func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer) {
        container[Columns.id] = id
        container[Columns.name] = name
        container[Columns.description] = description
        container[Columns.due] = due
        container[Columns.isDraft] = isDraft
        container[Columns.accentColor] = brand.accentColor
        container[Columns.bannerImage] = brand.bannerImage
    }

    mutating func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?) {
        id = rowID
    }

}
```

You'll see on line 7 that instead of `accentColor` and `bannerImage` keys in
the `Project` struct, we have a `brand` key of type `ProjectBrand`. Your struct
should represent your data as you want to use it in your app, now how it is
structured in the database.

The two main differences when compared to the `Project` struct we wrote in part
1 are the `init` and `encode` functions. The former is responsible for
modelling a database row into a `Project` when the database is read; you can
see that lines 27 through 30 transform the `accentColor` and `bannerImage`
rows into a `ProjectBrand`. The latter is responsible for splitting the
`Project` back down into database rows — lines 41 and 42 break down the
`ProjectBrand`.

With all that in place, here's an example of what a `Project` could look like
in your app:

```swift
try dbQueue.write { db in
    var projectBrand = ProjectBrand(
      accentColor: "#005eff",
      bannerImage: nil
    )

    var project = Project(
        name: "Advanced GRDB",
        description: "A blog post",
        due: Date().addingTimeInterval(24 * 60 * 60),
        isDraft: true,
        brand: projectBrand
    )

    try! project.insert(db)
}
```

You can see that we can now call `insert` directly on a `Project` type even
though it has a key that uses a custom data type. As we're writing to the
database in this case, the afore-defined `encode` function will run as part of
the write process and breakdown the `ProjectBrand`. Similarly, we could read a
`Project` and the `ProjectBrand` would be pre-assembled for us by the `init`
function.

```swift
try dbQueue.read { db in
  let project = try Project.fetchOne(db, key: 1)
  print(project)

  // => Project(id: nil, name: "Advanced GRDB", description: Optional("A blog post"), due: Optional(2019-12-11 14:16:15 +0000), isDraft: true, brand: ProjectBrand(accentColor: "#005eff", bannerImage: nil))
}
```

### Wrapping up

I hope this 2 part series — the first series I've ever published on this site —
has helped you get to grips with SQLite on iOS, and shown you its power and
ease of use when paired with GRDB.

There's no comment section on here, but I cross-post to
[dev.to](https://dev.to/elliotekj) which does have one. If you have any
questions, feel free to ask there.

Thanks for reading.
