Hi, I'm Elliot Jackson.

I build software for [fun](https://github.com/elliotekj) and
[profit](http://inthefield.co). Currently I freelance, taking on mainly iOS
design and/or development projects. Prior to that I worked at Realmac Software.

During my time in the industry, I've been fortunate enough to work at different
levels of the stack on a wide range of projects. Whilst the bulk of my client
work is iOS-centric these days, it's not the only type of work I enjoy doing,
as the posts here reflect.
