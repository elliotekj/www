Hi, I'm Elliot Jackson.

I build software for [fun](https://github.com/elliotekj) and [profit](/hire). 
Currently I freelance, taking on mainly iOS design and/or development 
projects. Prior to that I worked at Realmac Software.

During my time in the industry, I've been fortunate enough to work in different
roles on a wide range of projects. Whilst the bulk of my client
work is iOS-centric these days, it's not the only type of work I enjoy doing,
as the posts here reflect.
